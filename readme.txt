Hello!

This game can become very hard to beat. We thought of you, and thought it would be great
for you to get faster than intended to the boss battle. Why? We thought you probably have to
grade a lot of final projects before the deadline and could use the extra time.

Way of beating the game #1: THE STRATEGY
The current meta-strategy is to save up books, and avoid cats mainly by using jumps, in order
to have enough books to fire in a volley to the final boss as soon as it spawns. If you let the 
final boss live for a while, the screen will get much faster and the game will become impossible.
To aim for the final boss easily, this strategy indicates to be as close to the top of the screen
as possible when the boss spawns.

Way of beating the game #2: THE BYPASS
The game is meant to be hard, but beatable. We have chosen the timing of the final boss to balance this.
Nonetheless, if you want to evaluate this game fast, you can make the final boss appear almost
immediately (therefore seeing all the stages of the game in a shorter time) by changing self.targetValue
in line 616 of the code to 500.

We hope you enjoy the game!
